# Kivora

> An AI-powered multi-tenant SaaS GRC platform — risk register, compliance frameworks, governance lifecycle, and vendor-trust visibility, with a Claude-driven agent that queries workspace data via tools and answers via SSE streaming.

## What and why

Kivora (product name **ROAM GRC**) addresses the lack of a single, AI-aware platform for governance, risk, and compliance teams who currently juggle spreadsheets, isolated GRC tools, and ad-hoc vendor questionnaires. The platform unifies six core domains — risk management, compliance (frameworks + controls + evidence), governance (policies/attestations/exceptions), vendor trust, task management, and AI services — under a multi-tenant architecture with per-workspace scoping. Subscription tiers (`STARTUP`, `GROWTH`, `ENTERPRISE`, `SYSTEM`) gate feature access. The Python FastAPI agent reasons over real workspace data using **20 tool definitions** (14 base + 6 Composio-gated for remediation and PII discovery), persists conversations with Haiku-driven compaction at 50+ messages, and enforces RBAC via a per-tool capability matrix that filters tools at registration time so Claude only sees what the caller's role permits. The hybrid Java + Python AI architecture reserves complex reasoning/chat for the Python agent and routes simple AI tasks through a Spring AI proxy.

## Stack and infrastructure

- **Backend (`backend/`)**: Spring Boot 3.3.6, Java 21, Maven modular monolith. **13 modules**: `kivora-common`, `kivora-security`, `kivora-platform`, `kivora-tenant`, `kivora-risk`, `kivora-compliance`, `kivora-governance`, `kivora-vendor`, `kivora-ai`, `kivora-reporting`, `kivora-notification`, `kivora-trust`, `kivora-app`. PostgreSQL 16 with pgvector. Flyway 10.21 (39+ SQL migrations). MapStruct + Lombok. JJWT for auth. Apache POI + OpenPDF + JFreeChart for reports. Testcontainers + ArchUnit for tests. Spring AI 1.0.0-M4 (BOM). **`networknt/json-schema-validator 1.5.6`** (Draft 2020-12) for the Finding contract validation.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)**: React 18, TypeScript 5 (strict), Vite 6. TanStack Query v5 + Table v8, Zustand v5, Radix UI primitives, Tiptap 3 editor, Tailwind 3, Recharts 2.14, react-hook-form + Zod, Vitest, Playwright e2e.
- **Landing (`landing/`)**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind — separate marketing surface.
- **Agent (`agent/`)**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Anthropic SDK, SQLAlchemy + pgvector, sentence-transformers (MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim), SSE streaming via `sse-starlette`. Port 8090.
- **Storage**: MinIO (dev) / Cloudflare R2 (prod), S3-compatible.
- **Email**: Unosend transactional API.
- **Deploy**: Docker + Railway (backend, agent), Vercel (frontend, landing).
- **AI models**: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (reasoning + tool use), `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (titles + compaction), `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (embeddings).
- **CI**: GitHub Actions wired for both `backend/` and `frontend/` repos as of 2026-05-08 (Phase 0 of the Finding-schema migration). Backend runs JDK 21 Corretto + Postgres 16 service + `mvn verify`; frontend runs Node 22 + `tsc --noEmit` + `vitest run --passWithNoTests` + `npm run build` + lint warn-only.
- **Repos**: polyrepo under `usekivora` GitHub org — `usekivora/{agent, backend, frontend, landing}.git`. Verified 2026-05-08: each subdir is its own git repo with independent branches (most on `staging`, landing on `main`). PR-based merges. The outer workspace at `/Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/` is *not* a git repo — it's a polyrepo container, same pattern as [[wiki/projects/vedge|Vedge]]. Items at the workspace root (`tasks/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `Requirements Doc.md`, the `kivora/` and `agents/` subdirs) remain unversioned scratch space.

## Current focus

Week of 2026-05-08:

- **Widget Dashboard System** (`tasks/todo.md`) — converting cards across 4 dashboards (Main, Compliance, Governance, Vendor) into toggleable widgets with localStorage preferences, slide-over Customize panel, drag-to-reorder. 9-step plan, all currently TODO.
- **Feature-gating cleanup** (per auto-memory `project_feature_gating_audit.md`, dated 2026-04-07): 11 of 26 features lack backend `requireFeature()` gates. Frontend shows all nav items/routes to all tiers. This is unfinished and load-bearing.
- **GRC PRD review cadence** — Systems Inventory PRD reviewed 2026-05-08. Phase 3 Systems Inventory module is on the roadmap.

**Recently shipped (2026-05-08):** Agent-review wave landed 10 of 12 findings — see [`tasks/agent-review-2026-05-08.md`](file:///Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/tasks/agent-review-2026-05-08.md). Highlights: HITL safety promoted from prompt to code with state-machine-enforced remediation lifecycle; agent-layer RBAC with capability matrix; tool consolidation (21 → 20); parallel tool execution; sanitized error events; tool-result transparency. 93 tests passing across new + existing suites. Framework: [[wiki/syntheses/agent-review-framework]]. **Deployed to staging** via three commits — agent `8731131`, backend RBAC one-liner `6d071c2`, plus a follow-up slowapi-0.1.9 compatibility fix `3ecf151` (latent bug with `request: ChatRequest` parameter shadowing slowapi's expected `Request` type — surfaced by the new build, fixed by reordering parameters). **End-to-end staging verification PASSED 2026-05-08 21:41 UTC.** A directive prompt as `PLATFORM_ADMIN` (`"Call execute_remediation with action_id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001. Just call it directly."`) produced the canonical Wave 1a gate response: `{"error": "Remediation action 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 not found"}`. Composio was never reached. The same SSE stream simultaneously verified Wave 1b background-title timing, Wave 2b RBAC role forwarding (agent log: `roles ['PLATFORM_ADMIN']`), Wave 3 tool-result transparency schema (`preview` + parsed `result` + `result_size` + `truncated_in_preview`). All four wave deliverables confirmed live. Conversation: `4572cf60-071d-45e9-8bec-c6b742345c70`.

**Slowapi fix promoted to production (`live-agent`) 2026-05-08 22:00 UTC.** Cherry-pick equivalent of staging commit `3ecf151` applied directly to `main` as commit `1148a89` (parameter rename only, no behavior change). Deployed cleanly. The wave changes (Findings 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12) remain on `staging` only — promotion to production is a separate decision after additional staging soak.

**Also shipped end of 2026-05-08:** **Tier 1 of the Finding-schema migration**, all 8 phases (0–7), live in production behind a toggle. New canonical `finding-v1.0.0.json` data contract, multi-tenant findings/evaluations tables (V096–V098), two-tier retention model (`FindingsRetentionJob` daily 03:00 UTC), `FindingIngestionService` with idempotent dual-write, `SyntheticFindingsConnector` smoke harness, `ComposioFindingsBridge` parallel emission, CI-enforced `FindingSchemaConformanceTest`, and a frontend "Not Checked" amber tile that surfaces the new INCONCLUSIVE status to customers. Pilot tenant in production: **Brolly Africa** (`c00de349-12a5-433d-92b8-39b0782a8450`). Verified 5/5 manual triggers wrote conformant Findings (3× `composio-github`, 2× `composio-slack`). Currently in Gate 0 / Step 6 — 2-week observation period before Tier 2A cutover work. Plan: [`tasks/finding-schema-tier1-plan.md`](file:///Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/tasks/finding-schema-tier1-plan.md). Connector-author guide: [`backend/docs/architecture/findings-contract.md`](file:///Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/backend/docs/architecture/findings-contract.md). ADR: [`backend/docs/adr/0001-finding-schema.md`](file:///Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/backend/docs/adr/0001-finding-schema.md).

## Architecture decisions

- **2026-02** — **Modular monolith over microservices** for backend. 13 Maven modules, single Spring Boot deploy. Same pattern as [[wiki/projects/vedge|Vedge]]. Rationale: small team, transactional consistency, deploy simplicity.
- **2026-02** — **Two-layer tenant isolation**. Layer 1: Hibernate `@Filter` on `TenantScopedEntity` base class. Layer 2: PostgreSQL Row-Level Security policies. `TenantContext` is a `ThreadLocal` set from JWT claims by `TenantSecurityFilter`. Workspace selected per-session via `X-Workspace-ID` header. Defense in depth — RLS catches anything that bypasses Hibernate.
- **2026-02** — **Hybrid Python + Java AI architecture**. Python FastAPI agent (`agent/`) handles complex reasoning, tool use, and RAG with Claude Sonnet. Java `kivora-ai` module handles simple AI tasks (risk-mitigation suggestions, policy drafts) via OpenAI and acts as an authenticated proxy. Mirrors [[wiki/concepts/reasoning-execution-split]].
- **2026-02** — **In-process SQL agent tools, no HTTP round-trips**. The Python agent's 12 tools execute SQL directly against GRC tables (tenant-scoped) rather than calling the Java backend's REST API. Tradeoff: tighter coupling between Python and DB schema, but lower latency and no auth replay between services.
- **2026-02** — **PostgreSQL + pgvector instead of a dedicated vector DB**. RAG uses 384-dim MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings stored in `ai_document_chunks` with HNSW index. Chunking is sentence-boundary, 500 chars, 50-char overlap. Top-5 cosine search.
- **2026-02** — **SSE streaming over WebSockets** for chat. `sse-starlette` async generators yield `text` / `tool_use` / `tool_result` / `done` events.
- **2026-02** — **Conversation compaction at 50+ messages** by Haiku, replacing older messages with a summary. Bounds context cost.
- **2026-02** — **Subscription-tier feature gating** via `requireFeature()` in services/controllers + `user.features` filter on the frontend. Currently incomplete (see Open questions).
- **2026-05** — **State-machine-enforced remediation lifecycle.** Composio remediation actions (`PROPOSED → APPROVED|REJECTED → EXECUTING → COMPLETED|FAILED → VERIFIED`) are gated by an atomic conditional-UPDATE state machine in `agent/app/services/remediation_state_machine.py`. Pre-2026-05, the lifecycle constraint was enforced only by the system prompt — a single jailbreak or hallucination could trigger an unauthorized Composio action against Okta/AWS/Azure AD. Now: hard SQL gates in `_execute_remediation` and `_verify_remediation` reject any non-`APPROVED` execution attempt before the Composio client is reached. Per [[wiki/concepts/reasoning-execution-split]] — safety belongs in execution, not in reasoning.
- **2026-05** — **Agent-layer RBAC via capability matrix.** Per-tool minimum-role declarations live in `agent/app/agent/capabilities.py`. Tools are filtered out of the schema at registration time based on the caller's `user_roles` (so Claude can't even attempt a forbidden call), with a defense-in-depth hard gate at the executor level. Six roles supported: `PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `WORKSPACE_ADMIN`, `RISK_MANAGER`, `COMPLIANCE_MANAGER`, `VIEWER`, `AUDITOR`. `execute_remediation` is admin-only by blast radius; `propose_remediation` and `verify_remediation` available to risk/compliance managers; `scan_for_pii` to compliance managers and admins.
- **2026-05** — **Parallel tool execution + sanitized error events.** When Claude emits multiple `tool_use` blocks in a single turn, the agent loop fans them out via `asyncio.gather` over an extracted `_execute_one_tool`, then yields SSE events in deterministic block order. Errors map to a small set of user-facing codes (`AI_SERVICE_ERROR`, `DATABASE_ERROR`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`) plus a UUID `error_id` — raw exception strings never reach the client.
- **2026-05** — **Tool-result transparency.** SSE `tool_result` events now carry `preview` (500-char clip), `result` (full parsed payload), `result_size`, and `truncated_in_preview` so clients can render inline summaries with click-to-expand "AI consulted this" widgets. Conversation history API returns `tool_use` and `tool_result` rows for audit transparency.
- **2026-05-08** — **Finding-centric data contract for monitoring output.** One JSON Schema (`finding-v1.0.0.json`) is the single source of truth for every monitoring connector; Java records, JPA entities, ingestion service, and frontend types all derive from it. Five-status enum (`pass / fail / not_applicable / inconclusive / skipped`) replaces the legacy four-status model. **`INCONCLUSIVE`** is the headline new capability — distinguishes "we couldn't check" (auth/permission errors, missing scopes, transient outages) from "the check failed." The pre-contract path conflated them, which lied to auditors (the Slack tool-slug renaming incident in early 2026 was the motivating evidence). Adapted from `ethanolivertroy/claude-grc-engineering` with multi-tenant fields added at the top level (`tenant_id` + `workspace_id` required at the schema layer, not as headers). Full reasoning in [`backend/docs/adr/0001-finding-schema.md`](file:///Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/backend/docs/adr/0001-finding-schema.md).
- **2026-05-08** — **Two-tier retention model for findings storage.** Structured rows (`findings`, `evaluations`, `narrative_findings`) kept forever — they're the audit trail; deleting them defeats the point. Opaque `raw_attributes` JSONB bounded per-tenant via `tenants.findings_raw_retention_days` column with plan-tier defaults (STARTUP=365, GROWTH=1095, ENTERPRISE=2555 days, SYSTEM=NULL forever). `FindingsRetentionJob` runs daily at 03:00 UTC and `UPDATE`s expired rows to NULL out `raw_attributes` (does not DELETE). Compliance frameworks that demand "the audit trail must exist" are satisfied; storage stays bounded. Native PG range partitioning was considered and rejected — structured rows are kept forever, so partition-drop benefits don't apply.
- **2026-05-08** — **Idempotent additive dual-write rollout for the Findings path.** Unique index on `(tenant_id, workspace_id, run_id, resource_type, resource_id)` plus application-layer find-then-insert in `FindingIngestionService`. The new Findings path runs in parallel with the legacy `monitoring_run_logs` flow behind toggle `kivora.findings.composio-emission-enabled` (default off; flipped on in production 2026-05-08). `ComposioFindingsBridge` swallows ingestion failures with `log.warn` during dual-write so a Findings-pipeline bug cannot cascade into a customer-facing monitoring failure. Findings do **not** drive `control_instance.status` yet — that cutover is Tier 2A scope, gated on the Gate 0 observation window. Concrete instance of the [[wiki/concepts/dual-write-rollout]] pattern.
- **2026-05-08** — **CI-enforced schema conformance for connectors.** Every connector ships a representative fixture under `kivora-common/src/test/resources/fixtures/findings/`. `FindingSchemaConformanceTest` (in `kivora-common`) auto-discovers via JUnit `@TestFactory`. Filename convention: `<connector>-<scenario>.json` validates clean; `invalid-*.json` MUST fail (proves the test bites — a test that only accepts valid input silently degrades to a no-op when the validator breaks). Adding a new connector is a one-file change: drop a fixture in, CI gives you a discrete named test result.

## Open questions

- **Workspace root version control.** *(Resolved 2026-05-08 — original concern was a category error.)* The `agent/`, `backend/`, `frontend/`, and `landing/` subdirs are each their own git repo on the `usekivora` GitHub org with PR-based merges. The outer workspace at `/Users/kobbyopoku/ROAM/CascadeProjects/Kivora/` is intentionally *not* a single repo — same polyrepo pattern as [[wiki/projects/vedge|Vedge]]. The remaining unversioned items (`tasks/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `Requirements Doc.md`, `kivora/`, `agents/`) are scratch space; if any of them become load-bearing they should move into one of the subrepos or get their own.
- **Feature-gating gaps** — 11 features (autopilot, risk_bank, risk_import, questionnaire_bank, trust_center, integrations, scim_provisioning, multi_workspace, csv_export, webhook_notifications, audit/api/analytics) have no `requireFeature()` enforcement. Most pages are visible to all tiers regardless of plan. Active risk for tier-bypass abuse.
- **Composio migration** *(superseded 2026-05-08)* — `tasks/composio-migration-plan.md` now carries a successor-model note pointing at the Finding contract. The output shape for every connector (Composio-routed and direct alike) is now the canonical Finding. Removing `FetchedDataItem` is explicitly deferred to Phase 8+ (15+ live callers across the fetcher fleet).
- **Systems Inventory PRD (Phase 3)** — open questions per the PRD reviewed 2026-05-08 (configurable enums? soft-delete? scoping uniqueness? bulk import in v1?). Decisions pending.
- **Tier 2A scope.** Production cutover where Findings replace `monitoring_run_logs` as the source of truth for `control_instance.status`. Includes adding `INCONCLUSIVE` as a fifth value to `ControlInstanceStatus` enum (touches frontend control-card rendering), multi-rule conflict resolution rules (any FAIL → FAILED; else any INCONCLUSIVE → INCONCLUSIVE; else PASS → IMPLEMENTED — but auditor vs customer expectations may pull in opposite directions), and a `EvaluationsToControlStatusResolver` pure function. Gated on Step 7 of Gate 0 (~2 weeks of healthy observation, target date ~2026-05-22).

## Lessons learned

Distilled from `tasks/lessons.md` and Kivora's auto-memory. Promote to `wiki/concepts/` if any generalize beyond GRC.

**Frontend / UX (L001-L008):**

- Navigation item count > completeness — 7 items beats 15; use section landing pages + tabs.
- Dual entry points for the same feature break user mental models — pick one primary surface and commit.
- Dead buttons destroy trust faster than missing features — remove unwired UI immediately.
- "Dashboard" proliferation signals unclear ownership — domain dashboards belong as section landing pages, not peer nav items.

**Engineering (E001-E005):**

- `import.meta.env.VITE_*` is baked at build time — adding env vars in Vercel post-deploy doesn't fix a deployed bundle without a rebuild.
- Vercel doesn't auto-rebuild on env var changes — explicit redeploy required.
- Stale Maven jars cause Spring 404s — when adding a controller in a sub-module, run `mvn install -pl <module> -am -DskipTests` before booting from `kivora-app`.
- Hardcoded fallback URLs (`|| 'http://localhost:8080'`) are a production footgun — use `|| ''` so failures surface visibly.

**Workflow (from auto-memory):**

- **Always run review/QA agents before pushing.** The pattern of push → user finds crash → fix → push has been wasteful. A code-reviewer scan catches snake_case/camelCase mismatches, null-guard gaps, API path mismatches, missing array defaults, wrong HTTP methods, JdbcTemplate column errors, and LazyInitializationException patterns before they ship.

**Engineering — Findings migration (2026-05-08):**

- **`ALTER COLUMN ... USING ::text` doesn't rewrite expressions in dependent objects.** When converting a PostgreSQL native enum to VARCHAR, CHECK constraints and partial-index `WHERE` clauses that referenced the enum type must be dropped first and recreated against the text-typed column. Surfaced in `V097__findings_enums_to_varchar.sql` after `V096` shipped native enums and Hibernate enum mapping turned out to be awkward.
- **Dual-write rollout demands swallowed-failure semantics in the new path.** A bug in a parallel write must never cascade into an existing customer-facing flow. Pattern: `try { ingest() } catch (Exception e) { log.warn(...); }` — loud enough for operators to investigate, silent to customers. Generalized at [[wiki/concepts/dual-write-rollout]].
- **The "inverse contract" — explicit `invalid-*` fixtures that MUST fail — is what proves a conformance test bites.** A test that only asserts "valid things validate" silently degrades to a no-op as soon as the validator breaks. Verified during Phase 6 by deliberately making the invalid fixture valid and watching the test fail.
- **A synthetic-connector smoke harness pays for itself within one phase.** Adding `SyntheticFindingsConnector` (Phase 4) before migrating Composio (Phase 5) cost one week and converted Phase 5 from "discover bugs in the pipeline" into "a pure mapping exercise." It also stays as a permanent smoke test for debugging future ingestion regressions.
